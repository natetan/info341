Telecomm Terms – LEC, CLEC, LATA, IXC etc 
clec - competitive lec, competition at lec level
What is the OSI reference model and its relevance in networking ?
defines interfaces between layers
 Point to Point vs Multipoint (adv/disadv)
- direct: easier to troubleshoot

- connects networks
What is multiplexing – what benefit does it provide. 
- lower costs. multiple signals on one wire
How is multiplexing critical in terms of long term network  directions and purchase decisions 
- 
What is protocol analysis – how did Wireshark lab help your      understanding of protocols ? 
- software that allows us to take bits and make it look like frames. 
Describe network topologies (associated adv/disadv) 
- 
What is meant by protocol layering ? 
- telnet inside tcp, tcp/ip inside ethernet
Why is HDLC protocol important to understand ?  Where is it used ? 
- basis of all protocols
TCP/IP protocol, IP addressing, ARIN, IETF, RFC’s, applications/ports 
- ARIN - get addresses
- IETF - dictate the rules of the internet
- RFC - anyone wants to do something with IP, 
- UDP vs TCP 

TCP vs UDP  (when would I worry about ?) Related to any other course concept ? 
TCP/IP User Application Protocols, FTP, Telnet, SMTP, SNMP, DNS, DHCP 
- smtp -email 
IP address classes, subnetting, subnet masking, gateway
MAC layer protocols  (understanding LAN traces)

Describe how you use static and dynamic (DHCP) IP addressing – when static/DHCP typically used        40%
- Most things are DHCP
- static is server
- use DHCP when you need mobility
Describe what changes need to be made to infrastructure to support static or DHCP (i.e router, end systems) 20%
- the changes need to be made to the end systems
Describe how to set up a DHCP address pool – and why it is important to specify address ranges (within a net which IP addresses are DHCP, which add’s would be static 
- define what the actual pool of addresses was
- include any excluded addresses
- it's important to specify ranges bc so it's not gonna give a dhcp address

DHCP lease time is set by the DCHP server

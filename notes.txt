Lecture 1

9.28.16

Latency - delay

Network types
	- LANs (Local Area Networks)
	- WANs
	- MANs

Multiplexing - Multiple signals allowed at the same time
	- The same fiber cable now supports 1000 connections at 190 gigabits persecond

Internet is a collection of LANs

Many different protocols out there

Common delivery protocol
	- Ethernet
	- 

Http Transaction
	- 

Layers
	1. Physical (access points)
	2. Address 
		- Mac address, LLC (logical link control)
	3. Network (IP address)
	4. Transport 
	5. Session
	6. Presentation
	7. Application

Divestiture
	1. AT&T had to breakup into different parts
		- They were a monopoly and had no innovation

Private/dedicated link environment
	- Long distance call
		LEC -> IXC -> LEC
	- Freedom to choose your carriers
	- You have to know where the problem is
		- Where is the problem?
	

Lecture 2

9.30.16

LANs
	- Privately owned
	- High speed
	- Shared media
		a. your boundaries
		b. radio signal - everyone connected to came channel
	- geographically limited to building or campus
		a. sending a singal through a copper wire only goes
		   so far (100 meters)
		b. the media used to make LANs are limited
	- Kinds of network
		a. Ethernet, wifi, 

Protocol - set of rules
	- we use the standard tcp/ip today
	- made us all common so we can use the same protocol

OSI Layers
	1. Physical
		- 
	2. Data Link
		- NIC, internet card inside the computer
		- Address of the NIC (burned into the NIC card)
			- Unique to every NIC card in the world

CSMA/CD, CA protocol
	1. Carrier sends a signal, then listens

What happens as networks grow?
	- Contention
		- Competing for the resource
		- Network contention protocols
		- I listen before I send, while I send

Access Points
	- RF side, and wired side
	- Connect to ethernet to router, to ethernet to router
	- Connection to Everett (fiber)

Network Topology - the way nodes are connected geometrically
	- Broadcast-oriented: all transmissions heard by all stations
	- Listening for many MAC addresses
	- Every device is listening for every frame that passes by

Ring Topology
	- Ability to wrap (self heal)
	- Circulate past all stations
	- Frame circulates back to source where it is removed

Simplex - one way
	- AM/FM radio (response goes one way)
Half deplux - send can receive but cant do it simultaneously
Full duplex - send and receive simultaneously

Star Topology
	- Each device connected  to a central node

ISPs connect together in San Jose (NAPs) - Network Access Points
	- A packet from Japan to Korea = packet from Japan to Cali to Korea

LATAs - when you go between LATAs, it's long distance
	- Anything within LATAs are local connections
	- Long distance carrer for between LATAs

Last Mile - Local Exchange Carrier from the office connects to your home

How to troubleshoot whether it's the app or network being slow?
	- Getting the frames

Private lines
	- Dictate the performance end to end (not shared)
	- Internet is shared so performance can be mysterious

Routers connect networks physically

Trusted connections
	- Own it
	- Multi-factor authentication
	- Locked data closets/wpa2-wifi

Carrier Hotel
	- Where carrier long distance terminates in a city
	- Seattle: Westin

Office to office connections
	- Connect to a local fiber

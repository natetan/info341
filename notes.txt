9.28.16

Latency - delay

Network types
	- LANs (Local Area Networks)
	- WANs
	- MANs

Multiplexing - Multiple signals allowed at the same time
	- The same fiber cable now supports 1000 connections at 190 gigabits persecond

Internet is a collection of LANs

Many different protocols out there

Common delivery protocol
	- Ethernet
	- 

Http Transaction
	- 

Layers
	1. Physical (access points)
	2. Address 
		- Mac address, LLC (logical link control)
	3. Network (IP address)
	4. Transport 
	5. Session
	6. Presentation
	7. Application

Divestiture
	1. AT&T had to breakup into different parts
		- They were a monopoly and had no innovation

Private/dedicated link environment
	- Long distance call
		LEC -> IXC -> LEC
	- Freedom to choose your carriers
	- You have to know where the problem is
		- Where is the problem?
	

Lecture 2

9.30.16

LANs
	- Privately owned
	- High speed
	- Shared media
		a. your boundaries
		b. radio signal - everyone connected to came channel
	- geographically limited to building or campus
		a. sending a singal through a copper wire only goes
		   so far (100 meters)
		b. the media used to make LANs are limited
	- Kinds of network
		a. Ethernet, wifi, 

Protocol - set of rules
	- we use the standard tcp/ip today
	- made us all common so we can use the same protocol

OSI Layers
	1. Physical
		- 
	2. Data Link
		- NIC, internet card inside the computer
		- Address of the NIC (burned into the NIC card)
			- Unique to every NIC card in the world
	3. 
	4.
	5.

CSMA/CD, CA protocol
	1. Carrier sends a signal, then listens

What happens as networks grow?
	- Contention
		- Competing for the resource
		- Network contention protocols
		- I listen before I send, while I send

Access Points
	- RF side, and wired side
	- Connect to ethernet to router, to ethernet to router
	- Connection to Everett (fiber)

Network Topology - the way nodes are connected geometrically
	- Broadcast-oriented: all transmissions heard by all stations
	- Listening for many MAC addresses
	- Every device is listening for every frame that passes by

Ring Topology
	- Ability to wrap (self heal)
	- Circulate past all stations
	- Frame circulates back to source where it is removed

Simplex - one way
	- AM/FM radio (response goes one way)
Half deplux - send can receive but cant do it simultaneously
Full duplex - send and receive simultaneously

Star Topology
	- Each device connected  to a central node

ISPs connect together in San Jose (NAPs) - Network Access Points
	- A packet from Japan to Korea = packet from Japan to Cali to Korea

LATAs - when you go between LATAs, it's long distance
	- Anything within LATAs are local connections
	- Long distance carrer for between LATAs

Last Mile - Local Exchange Carrier from the office connects to your home

How to troubleshoot whether it's the app or network being slow?
	- Getting the frames

Private lines
	- Dictate the performance end to end (not shared)
	- Internet is shared so performance can be mysterious

Routers connect networks physically

Trusted connections
	- Own it
	- Multi-factor authentication
	- Locked data closets/wpa2-wifi

Carrier Hotel
	- Where carrier long distance terminates in a city
	- Seattle: Westin

Office to office connections
	- Connect to a local fiber


Lecture 3
10.5.16

Why are cabling and media selection critical in networks?
	- 60% of your cost

EIA/TIA standards
	- breaks apart things into components
	- color coded in the ethernet

CAT 5e has almost entirely replaced CAT 5 in new installations

Plenum - really just air. 

UTP 
	- Advantages (everywhere, high speed, cheap)
	- Disadvantages (affected by EMI, difficult to splice

Attenuation - breakup of power over distance

Cable testing shows you sources of failures, including crosstalk, return loss,

Cable is a bus topology
	- Data goes through one cable (can be problematic - how do we make everyone's data private/)

Virtual LAN
	- Run multiple instances of the same LAN
	- Guest networks 

Multiple SSIDs can come with a LAN


Coaxial Cables
	- Single cable, high speeds

Baseband - single channeling 
Broadband - multiple channels (multiple apps simultaneously)

Fiber uses prisms to send different colors for different channels

Fiber Optic Cables
	- Multimode fiber used for short and medium distance applications (LANs)
		- 2 km
	- Single mode (lasers - long distance)
		- thousands of miles
	
	- Advantages
		- super high speeds supported
		- not affected by electromagnetic radiation
		- less signal attenuation
		- no electrical hazard
	- Disadvantages
		- Expensive 
		- Difficult to splice
	
Measuring optic fiber singal strength
	- Power meter

Microwave communications
	- put in places that are difficult to wire
	- cost effective
	- easy to install
	- high speeds available

	- limited to line of sight (30 miles, curvature of the earth)
	- adversely affected by the weather

Lecture 4
10.7.16

Satellite Communications
	- Advantages
		- High speed
		- Cost is not distance dependent 
	- Disadvantages
		- .5 second delay
		- Sensitive to sunspots
		- Constant realigning 
	- Inferior to a lot of other communications
		- Really only use it when you can't do anything else
			- Alaska, 3rd world countries
	- RF at the physical layer
	- Transmits frames
		- Keeps track of frame number, their address, 
	- It's data link 
		- Sends data over a link
	- Asynchronous - 1 character at a time
	- Synchronous - 1 block at a time
	- You'd want more frames in satellite communications
		- More efficient

Frames are blocks

The more reliable the media, the larger the block frame
	- Reliable media: fiber, Coax, copper, wired stuff
	- Unreliable media: wireless
	- Unguided media is more unreliable

How big should a block be?
	- Depends on the media
	- Big blocks for fiber, but less number of blocks, since it is reliable

How many frames?
	- Depends on the media

UDP should only be used over reliable media

Simplest protocols in the world
	- Xon
	- Xoff
	- They are flow control protocols

Wireless Communications
	- 2,4 GHz + 5 GHz
	- 2 most important things
		- Channels and power
	- Frequency Hopping
		- Constantly changing channel
			- So people can't tune in to you
	
	- Advantages
		- High speed
		- Cost effective
		- Easy to install
	- Disadvantages
		- Distance/cell size
		- Interference - adversely affected by other 802.11
		- Transmission insecure


Access points always stay on the same channels
	- Devices are the ones that move (roaming)

SSIDs - name for the network

Unlicensed frequency - anyone can use it

Licensed frequency - used for secure networks

Data Link Protocols - Rules which govern the way in which computing/network devices communicate at layer 2
	- asynch, bisynch, SDLC, HDLC
	- HDLC 
		- Bit oriented protocol 
		- 1 - 128 frames

Functions of a Data Link Protocol (quiz/test/exam)
	- Synchronization
		- Establishing and maintaining synchronization between sender and receiver
		- start bits and stop bits (in asynch, since there is no timing)
	- Framing
		- Protocol must be capable of marking the beginning and end of each transmission frame
	- Control
		- Protocol must perform minimum set of control functions
	- Error Detection
		- Must perform some degree of error detection

Starting a session, goes through broadcasting

IP - packets, ehternet - frames

Do the broadcast bc u dont know the MAC address, only the IP address

Lecture 5
10.12.16

Ethernet is a data link

Licensed vs unlicensed frequency
	- Licensed (only you can use it)
	- Unlicensed (anybody can use it)

Every factory has metal and wireless cannot go through metal

Where do we get our frequencies from? (quiz/test/exam)
	- FCC

Quiz / midterm / test question

advantages/disadvantages of these media

copper 
	- high speed
	- cheap
	- available

	- distance is limited (330 feet)
	- splicing is difficult

fiber
	- high speed
	- resistant to electromagnetic interference
	- good distance
	- broadband (multiple channels)

	- components are expensive
	- difficult to splice
microwave
	- cheap
	- high speed
	- easy to install
	- not tied to a structure (mobile)

	- 30 mile distance (curvature of the earth)
	- affected by weather

satellite
	- high speed
	- cost is not distance dependent
	- long distance

	- affected by sunpots
	- propagation deplay
	- have to be realigned

Case Study

We have a data center with 100 servers

Laptops on floors above

Brand new building

- First: ask how long we're gonna be there
- How much downtime can we allow?
- What will an hour of downtime cost us?


Fiber for vertical distribution
	- going up floors
	- can go 1 km
Copper for horizontal distribution
	- For the single floorv(distance limited)

Executives should be on a separate network
	- Use a VLAN
Systems Admins (1st floor, regular users)
	- 


What does a VLAN have to do with media?
	- 

Relationship between data link protocols and media
	- latency, distance
	- The more unreliable the media, the smaller thr frames


One character at a time - use parity checking 

Algorithm generates a checksum. The other side does the same thing.
If these have the same, then it's good

Data link ethernet frame

flag -> address -> control -> info -> fcs -> flag

address: form it came from (your NIC card)

Phy protocols (physical) - csma/cd

Data Link layer is split into MAC and LLC (logical link control)
	- MAC is just ur address
	- send, acknowledge
	- LLC is the sequencing (how many frames?)
		- waiting for frames


Multiplexing - The ability to send multiple signals over 1 fiber

- Treats each line like a dedicated line (think it's the only one on the line)

1 line that connects the mux together

DEC-----                 ----DEC
IPX ----- mux--------mux ----IPX
IP------                 ----IP

Problems - Time division is not adequate

Statistical time division multiplexing

Network contention - Nothing to send, doesn't take a time slot

40 Gigabits over 1 wire

1000 40 gigabits, one fiber (single mode fiber)


Transceiver - listen before/during I send
Wireless doesn't use transceiver because it is half duplex
Wireless uses CA so it doesn't buy that transceiver

3 contention methods for wireless

	- Polling
	- CSMA/CD
	- CSMA/CA

Lecture 6
10.14.16

LAN Overview

Shared media - have to listen before it sends

CSMA/D - Listen before I send and listen while I send

LAN applications
	- High speed office networks
	- Storage area networks
		- The boxes in server farms
	- Factory/manufacturing networks
	- Backbone LANs
		- Interconnect local lans
		- No end systems connected to it
			- Switch/routers aren't end devices 
			- Backbone connects intermediate systems
		- They do this to avoid contention 

Data Link layer is split in 2 to split its functions
	- MAC (just the address of the nic)
	- LLC (does the rest)

Ring Topology - Always guaranteed to the local access network
Star Topology - Wrap - can self heal, but takes more wire and is expensive

802.3 is ethernet

Unicast - one address
Multicast - specific set of addresses
Broadcast - all addresses

Lecture 7
10.19.16

TCP/IP Protocol and Addressing

TCP/IP - set of protocols

Token Bus
	- Token is just the contention method and applies to different media

IP is about talking to everything

Distinguish appliactions based on their ports

NFS runs over UDP

know these for midterm/exam
 - SMTP
 - DNS 
 - NFS (Network File Server)
 - 

 Port numbers identify the application

 8 bits = 1 octet

 192.168.100.0
 4 octets (192)(168)(100)(0)

 32 bits / 4 = 8

 IP nums are from ISPs and ARIN

 routers connect networks

 Router is a layer 3 device

 It's a network address if the last octet ends in a 0

 IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) - needs a port for his application

 pc / laptop asks for these things
 	- Ip address
	- subnet mask
	- default gateway/router
	- broadcast address

Subnet Mask - Asks which portion of your ip address is allocated to network bits
	- 255.255.255.0

Default gateway - 192.168.1.1

ARIN is better, so u dont get locked into ur ISP

Class A address
	- 1.0.0.0 - 127.0.0.0 (reserved), so it only goes to 126.0.0.0

	- on 12.0.0.0, the first available device would get 12.0.0.1

	- 255.0.0.0

Class B Address
	- 128.1.0.0 - 191.254.0.0
	- 2 octets filled in
	- Mask: 255.255.0.0

Class c Address
	- 3 octets are filled in
	- 255.255.255.0

Lecture 8
10.21.16

envelope tcp/ip - midterm/exam

	- ip contains tcp/ tcp contains telnet/ 

type field vs length field -  midterm/exam
	- the fields tell u the different protocols
	- dix is proprietery
	- ethernet is open (standard)

network contention - competing for the network/media - midterm/exam

	-  multiplexing: multiple connections on one link
	- polling
	- token passing
	- csma/cd - listen before and while u send
		- bc of a transceiver 
		- wireless devices dont have a transceiver
	- csma/ca

	- csma/ca and csma/cd only works on LANs


point to point vs multipoint - midterm/exam
	- point to point: dont have to wait
		- all about being a better a troubleshooter
	- LAN: multipoint connection
		- hard to troubleshoot and figure out

Frame vs packet
	 - frame: data link layer (also called a block)
	 - tcp/ip: packets (network/transport layer)

flow control - midterm/exam
	- management of data flow between computers or devices or between nodes in a network so data can be handled at an efficient pace

IP classes - distinguished by the num of IP address they could have
	- A: N H H H  12.0.0.0       16M
	- B: N N H H  128.12.0.0     65K
	- C: N N N H  192.168.100.0  254

Router is network layer
	- router is not a switch

All hosts have to point to the default network

Subnet
	- making one network look like many networks

Broadcast would be 128..10.2.255 <-- last one is 255, bc it broadcasts to all machines

Broadcast storm: Send a broadcast no one can respond to - consumes the entire network

Public address - reachable thru the internet

private address - people who got them from ARIN
	- give other ppl some space


Example

ARIN gave you 192.76.210.0

You have 8 bits

Split it, and u get 14|14

N|H
128 62 32 16 | 8 4 2 1

First available network: 192.76.210.16
Router: 192.76.210.17
Mask: 255.255.255.240 (16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240)
Broadcast: 192.76.210.31 (16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31)

next one
network 192.76.210.32
ip/router: 192.76.210.33
Mask: 255.255.255.240
Broadcast: 192.76.210.47 (32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 47)

General rule: stay on even bit boundaries

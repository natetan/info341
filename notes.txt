	- LANs (Local Area Networks)
	- WANs
	- MANs

Multiplexing - Multiple signals allowed at the same time
	- The same fiber cable now supports 1000 connections at 190 gigabits persecond

Internet is a collection of LANs

Many different protocols out there

Common delivery protocol
	- Ethernet
	- 

Http Transaction
	- 

Layers
	1. Physical (access points)
	2. Address 
		- Mac address, LLC (logical link control)
	3. Network (IP address)
	4. Transport 
	5. Session
	6. Presentation

Divestiture
	1. AT&T had to breakup into different parts
		- They were a monopoly and had no innovation

Private/dedicated link environment
	- Long distance call
		LEC -> IXC -> LEC
	- Freedom to choose your carriers
	- You have to know where the problem is
		- Where is the problem?
	

Lecture 2

9.30.16

LANs
	- Privately owned
	- High speed
	- Shared media
		a. your boundaries
		b. radio signal - everyone connected to came channel
	- geographically limited to building or campus
		a. sending a singal through a copper wire only goes
		   so far (100 meters)
		b. the media used to make LANs are limited
	- Kinds of network
		a. Ethernet, wifi, 

Protocol - set of rules
	- we use the standard tcp/ip today
	- made us all common so we can use the same protocol

OSI Layers
	1. Physical
		- 
	2. Data Link
		- NIC, internet card inside the computer
		- Address of the NIC (burned into the NIC card)
			- Unique to every NIC card in the world

CSMA/CD, CA protocol
	1. Carrier sends a signal, then listens

What happens as networks grow?
	- Contention
		- Competing for the resource
		- Network contention protocols
		- I listen before I send, while I send

Access Points
	- RF side, and wired side
	- Connect to ethernet to router, to ethernet to router
	- Connection to Everett (fiber)

Network Topology - the way nodes are connected geometrically
	- Broadcast-oriented: all transmissions heard by all stations
	- Listening for many MAC addresses
	- Every device is listening for every frame that passes by

Ring Topology
	- Ability to wrap (self heal)
	- Circulate past all stations
	- Frame circulates back to source where it is removed

Simplex - one way
	- AM/FM radio (response goes one way)
Half deplux - send can receive but cant do it simultaneously
Full duplex - send and receive simultaneously

Star Topology
	- Each device connected  to a central node

ISPs connect together in San Jose (NAPs) - Network Access Points
	- A packet from Japan to Korea = packet from Japan to Cali to Korea

LATAs - when you go between LATAs, it's long distance
	- Anything within LATAs are local connections
	- Long distance carrer for between LATAs

Last Mile - Local Exchange Carrier from the office connects to your home

How to troubleshoot whether it's the app or network being slow?
	- Getting the frames

Private lines
	- Dictate the performance end to end (not shared)
	- Internet is shared so performance can be mysterious

Routers connect networks physically

Trusted connections
	- Own it
	- Multi-factor authentication
	- Locked data closets/wpa2-wifi

Carrier Hotel
	- Where carrier long distance terminates in a city
	- Seattle: Westin

Office to office connections
	- Connect to a local fiber


Lecture 3
10.5.16

Why are cabling and media selection critical in networks?
	- 60% of your cost

EIA/TIA standards
	- breaks apart things into components
	- color coded in the ethernet

CAT 5e has almost entirely replaced CAT 5 in new installations

Plenum - really just air. 

UTP 
	- Advantages (everywhere, high speed, cheap)
	- Disadvantages (affected by EMI, difficult to splice

Attenuation - breakup of power over distance

Cable testing shows you sources of failures, including crosstalk, return loss,

Cable is a bus topology
	- Data goes through one cable (can be problematic - how do we make everyone's data private/)

Virtual LAN
	- Run multiple instances of the same LAN
	- Guest networks 

Multiple SSIDs can come with a LAN


Coaxial Cables
	- Single cable, high speeds

Baseband - single channeling 
Broadband - multiple channels (multiple apps simultaneously)

Fiber uses prisms to send different colors for different channels

Fiber Optic Cables
	- Multimode fiber used for short and medium distance applications (LANs)
		- 2 km
	- Single mode (lasers - long distance)
		- thousands of miles
	
	- Advantages
		- super high speeds supported
		- not affected by electromagnetic radiation
		- less signal attenuation
		- no electrical hazard
	- Disadvantages
		- Expensive 
		- Difficult to splice
	
Measuring optic fiber singal strength
	- Power meter

Microwave communications
	- put in places that are difficult to wire
	- cost effective
	- easy to install
	- high speeds available

	- limited to line of sight (30 miles, curvature of the earth)
	- adversely affected by the weather

Lecture 4
10.7.16

Satellite Communications
	- Advantages
		- High speed
		- Cost is not distance dependent 
	- Disadvantages
		- .5 second delay
		- Sensitive to sunspots
		- Constant realigning 
	- Inferior to a lot of other communications
		- Really only use it when you can't do anything else
			- Alaska, 3rd world countries
	- RF at the physical layer
	- Transmits frames
		- Keeps track of frame number, their address, 
	- It's data link 
		- Sends data over a link
	- Asynchronous - 1 character at a time
	- Synchronous - 1 block at a time
	- You'd want more frames in satellite communications
		- More efficient

Frames are blocks

The more reliable the media, the larger the block frame
	- Reliable media: fiber, Coax, copper, wired stuff
	- Unreliable media: wireless
	- Unguided media is more unreliable

How big should a block be?
	- Depends on the media
	- Big blocks for fiber, but less number of blocks, since it is reliable

How many frames?
	- Depends on the media

UDP should only be used over reliable media

Simplest protocols in the world
	- Xon
	- Xoff
	- They are flow control protocols

Wireless Communications
	- 2,4 GHz + 5 GHz
	- 2 most important things
		- Channels and power
	- Frequency Hopping
		- Constantly changing channel
			- So people can't tune in to you
	
	- Advantages
		- High speed
		- Cost effective
		- Easy to install
	- Disadvantages
		- Distance/cell size
		- Interference - adversely affected by other 802.11
		- Transmission insecure


Access points always stay on the same channels
	- Devices are the ones that move (roaming)

SSIDs - name for the network

Unlicensed frequency - anyone can use it

Licensed frequency - used for secure networks

Data Link Protocols - Rules which govern the way in which computing/network devices communicate at layer 2
	- asynch, bisynch, SDLC, HDLC
	- HDLC 
		- Bit oriented protocol 
		- 1 - 128 frames

Functions of a Data Link Protocol (quiz/test/exam)
	- Synchronization
		- Establishing and maintaining synchronization between sender and receiver
		- start bits and stop bits (in asynch, since there is no timing)
	- Framing
		- Protocol must be capable of marking the beginning and end of each transmission frame
	- Control
		- Protocol must perform minimum set of control functions
	- Error Detection
		- Must perform some degree of error detection

Starting a session, goes through broadcasting

IP - packets, ehternet - frames

Do the broadcast bc u dont know the MAC address, only the IP address

Lecture 5
10.12.16

Ethernet is a data link

Licensed vs unlicensed frequency
	- Licensed (only you can use it)
	- Unlicensed (anybody can use it)

Every factory has metal and wireless cannot go through metal

Where do we get our frequencies from? (quiz/test/exam)
	- FCC

Quiz / midterm / test question

advantages/disadvantages of these media

copper 
	- high speed
	- cheap
	- available

	- distance is limited (330 feet)
	- splicing is difficult

fiber
	- high speed
	- resistant to electromagnetic interference
	- good distance
	- broadband (multiple channels)

	- components are expensive
	- difficult to splice
microwave
	- cheap
	- high speed
	- easy to install
	- not tied to a structure (mobile)

	- 30 mile distance (curvature of the earth)
	- affected by weather

satellite
	- high speed
	- cost is not distance dependent
	- long distance

	- affected by sunpots
	- propagation deplay
	- have to be realigned

Case Study

We have a data center with 100 servers

Laptops on floors above

Brand new building

- First: ask how long we're gonna be there
- How much downtime can we allow?
- What will an hour of downtime cost us?


Fiber for vertical distribution
	- going up floors
	- can go 1 km
Copper for horizontal distribution
	- For the single floorv(distance limited)

Executives should be on a separate network
	- Use a VLAN
Systems Admins (1st floor, regular users)
	- 


What does a VLAN have to do with media?
	- 

Relationship between data link protocols and media
	- latency, distance
	- The more unreliable the media, the smaller thr frames


One character at a time - use parity checking 

Algorithm generates a checksum. The other side does the same thing.
If these have the same, then it's good

Data link ethernet frame

flag -> address -> control -> info -> fcs -> flag

address: form it came from (your NIC card)

Phy protocols (physical) - csma/cd

Data Link layer is split into MAC and LLC (logical link control)
	- MAC is just ur address
	- send, acknowledge
	- LLC is the sequencing (how many frames?)
		- waiting for frames


Multiplexing - The ability to send multiple signals over 1 fiber

- Treats each line like a dedicated line (think it's the only one on the line)

1 line that connects the mux together

DEC-----                 ----DEC
IPX ----- mux--------mux ----IPX
IP------                 ----IP

Problems - Time division is not adequate

Statistical time division multiplexing

Network contention - Nothing to send, doesn't take a time slot

40 Gigabits over 1 wire

1000 40 gigabits, one fiber (single mode fiber)


Transceiver - listen before/during I send
Wireless doesn't use transceiver because it is half duplex
Wireless uses CA so it doesn't buy that transceiver

3 contention methods for wireless

	- Polling
	- CSMA/CD
	- CSMA/CA

Lecture 6
10.14.16

LAN Overview

Shared media - have to listen before it sends

CSMA/D - Listen before I send and listen while I send

LAN applications
	- High speed office networks
	- Storage area networks
		- The boxes in server farms
	- Factory/manufacturing networks
	- Backbone LANs
		- Interconnect local lans
		- No end systems connected to it
			- Switch/routers aren't end devices 
			- Backbone connects intermediate systems
		- They do this to avoid contention 

Data Link layer is split in 2 to split its functions
	- MAC (just the address of the nic)
	- LLC (does the rest)

Ring Topology - Always guaranteed to the local access network
Star Topology - Wrap - can self heal, but takes more wire and is expensive

802.3 is ethernet

Unicast - one address
Multicast - specific set of addresses
Broadcast - all addresses

Lecture 7
10.19.16

TCP/IP Protocol and Addressing

TCP/IP - set of protocols

Token Bus
	- Token is just the contention method and applies to different media

IP is about talking to everything

Distinguish appliactions based on their ports

NFS runs over UDP

know these for midterm/exam
 - SMTP
 - DNS 
 - NFS (Network File Server)
 - 

 Port numbers identify the application

 8 bits = 1 octet

 192.168.100.0
 4 octets (192)(168)(100)(0)

 32 bits / 4 = 8

 IP nums are from ISPs and ARIN

 routers connect networks

 Router is a layer 3 device

 It's a network address if the last octet ends in a 0

 IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) - needs a port for his application

 pc / laptop asks for these things
 	- Ip address
	- subnet mask
	- default gateway/router
	- broadcast address

Subnet Mask - Asks which portion of your ip address is allocated to network bits
	- 255.255.255.0

Default gateway - 192.168.1.1

ARIN is better, so u dont get locked into ur ISP

Class A address
	- 1.0.0.0 - 127.0.0.0 (reserved), so it only goes to 126.0.0.0

	- on 12.0.0.0, the first available device would get 12.0.0.1

	- 255.0.0.0

Class B Address
	- 128.1.0.0 - 191.254.0.0
	- 2 octets filled in
	- Mask: 255.255.0.0

Class c Address
	- 3 octets are filled in
	- 255.255.255.0

Lecture 8
10.21.16

envelope tcp/ip - midterm/exam

	- ip contains tcp/ tcp contains telnet/ 

type field vs length field -  midterm/exam
	- the fields tell u the different protocols
	- dix is proprietery
	- ethernet is open (standard)

network contention - competing for the network/media - midterm/exam

	-  multiplexing: multiple connections on one link
	- polling
	- token passing
	- csma/cd - listen before and while u send
		- bc of a transceiver 
		- wireless devices dont have a transceiver
	- csma/ca

	- csma/ca and csma/cd only works on LANs


point to point vs multipoint - midterm/exam
	- point to point: dont have to wait
		- all about being a better a troubleshooter
	- LAN: multipoint connection
		- hard to troubleshoot and figure out

Frame vs packet
	 - frame: data link layer (also called a block)
	 - tcp/ip: packets (network/transport layer)

flow control - midterm/exam
	- management of data flow between computers or devices or between nodes in a network so data can be handled at an efficient pace

IP classes - distinguished by the num of IP address they could have
	- A: N H H H  12.0.0.0       16M
	- B: N N H H  128.12.0.0     65K
	- C: N N N H  192.168.100.0  254

Router is network layer
	- router is not a switch

All hosts have to point to the default network

Subnet
	- making one network look like many networks

Broadcast would be 128..10.2.255 <-- last one is 255, bc it broadcasts to all machines

Broadcast storm: Send a broadcast no one can respond to - consumes the entire network

Public address - reachable thru the internet

private address - people who got them from ARIN
	- give other ppl some space


Example

ARIN gave you 192.76.210.0

You have 8 bits

Split it, and u get 14|14

N|H
128 62 32 16 | 8 4 2 1

First available network: 192.76.210.16
Router: 192.76.210.17
Mask: 255.255.255.240 (16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240)
Broadcast: 192.76.210.31 (16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31)

next one
network 192.76.210.32
ip/router: 192.76.210.33
Mask: 255.255.255.240
Broadcast: 192.76.210.47 (32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 47)

General rule: stay on even bit boundaries

Almost everything is based on network based protocols. All tools are based on network protocols. midterm/exam
Proxy server: takes all web traffic and goes to the proxy server so it can be monitored. midterm/exam

Lecture 9
10.28.16

ACL - access list (permit IPs)
	- Permit 193.72.12.250 port 21
	- Permits that address to use FTP

Convergence (midterm/exam)


Lecture 10
11.2.16

MTU - Maximum transmission unit (exam)
DWDM - fiber optic (prism)      (exam)
Networks related to cybersecurity (exam)
	- Almost all security mechanisms are based on network protocols


Routing - process of forwarding an item from one location to another
	- They forward traffic
	- 2 major functions
		- Routing: learning the logical topology of the network
		- Forwarding: Forwarding packets from an inbound interface to an outbound interface

Routing tables contain routes learned from neighbors

RIP (routing information protocol)

Two routers within an autonomous system are called interior

Autonomous sytem - under one administrative control

Exchange touring tables if part of the same AS

All routers talk to each other if they have the same AS

Security Perimeter - sacrifical LAN
	- sits between inner layer and outer layer
	- 

Intrusion detection devices 
	- Malware is a program

Host Security Protocols

Security is all about oruting

BGP - Border Gateway Protocol
	- Router uses it to connect to the internet

When routing protocol asks u for number, it asks for the ARIN number

Interior Gateway Protocols - Routing your own systems
	- Used for routing within networks under a common network administration (AS)
	- RIP, OSPF, EIGRP (distance vector)
Exterior Gateway Protocols - The internet
	- Route packets to other autonomous systems
	- BGP is an example of an EGP

Hops: One portion of the path between source and destination 
	- Data packets pass through bridges, routers, and gateways between source and destination

Hop Count: number of hops it takes (# of devices data has to pas through between source and destination)

Peering points for a lot of asian countries are in San Jose, California

Routing applies to your ISP connection

Peering point locations dictate your redundancy

Should choose Tier 1 - for redundancy and service

Tier 2 buy access to tier 1

Intranet - ur internal network

Lecture 11
11.4.16

Windowing - sending multiple packets and getting multiple acknowledgements back

Show IP route to look at routing tables

NAT - Network Address Translation
	- Allows to have a reachable network

Autonomous System - set of routers under a single admin (exam)
	- everyone is using the same rules

BGP connects As's

Static routes can connect other vendors

Convergence - Fail-over. Reroute. How long it takes to reroute when a box fails
	- the time it takes to reroute

Distance Vector updates every 30 seconds

Link state vs distance vector
	- Distance vector does periodic updates
		- affects convergence

LAN Repeater - more distance, but more collisions (since its purpose puts more things on the network)

Bridge (3 basic functions - exam)
	1. Build a table listing all layer 2 address and source port
	2. Make forwarding decisions based on destination address
	3. Filter if destination and source are on the same port
	4. Forward if source and destination are on different ports
	5. Break loops (spanning tree)

The job of a bridge is to forward
bridge - bridge table: MAC addresses
	- forward all broadcast, multicast, unicast frames (exam)



The bridge splits the layer and only takes the IP part and leaves the collions behind
The other networks are isolated since the router separates that 

Port mirroring - mirror the port, and they're on the same ethernet




Routers stop broadcast storms from propogating



Lecture 12: VLAN and Switching

Physical level - hubs and repeaters
Data Link level - bridges and switches 

Shared media: used coaxial cables
	- every device sees every transmitted frame
	- every device sees every collision
	- half duplex

Hubs emulate coaxial cable (half-duplex)

Broadcast domain
	- seen by all devices 
	- all frames in an all hub network are treated the same as a broadcast

Collision domain
	- Any 2 devices transmitting at the same time will collide

Bridge splits collision domain in 2
	- Bridge knows to either forward or not
	- Filter (discard) if source and destination are on the same port

Switch is a multi-port bridge
	- each segment detween two devices is a separate collision domain 
		- uses separate wire pairs
		- capable of full-duplex
		- collision free segment
		- capable of independent bandwidth (speed) based on slowest device
			- slowest speed does not determine the overall speed
	- less collisions

More devices, more collisions
	- network will eventually fail since it cannot keep up

When you go with full-duplex, chances of collision are very small

Difference between switches and routers
	- routers can connect other networks, but switches cannot
	- switches hav buffering that allows the ability to keep legacy equipment in the network

Layer 3 switches have routers built into them (modern switches)

Normally, a router would have to connect 2 switches for 2 separate networks

Switches forward broadcast (routers never forward)

Lan switch complicates LAN troubleshooting
	- It would be hard to troubleshoot which device is causing the problem
	- mirroring needs to be set up to see the traffic on a different port

Port mirroring - security issue
	- You can watch the other traffic
	- Someone can be monitoring your traffic without you knowing with mirroring

Layer 2 switching
	- hardware based bridging
	- wire speed performance
		- same speed within the device as the ports themselves
	- high speed scalability
	- low latency
	- MAC address
	-low cost
	- only know layer 2 adderss (MAC)
	- local delivery system within network

End-to-end (long haul) ethernet
	- High speed capability is important

Why would a company use WAN over internet
	- for privacy

Companies are moving over to the internet since it is so much cheaper

3 basic switches of a switch
	- Build a CAM table listing all layer 2 addresses and source port
		- content addressable memory table (table of mac addresses, and the port address it came on)
	- Make forwarding decisions based on destination MAC address
		- filter if source and destination are on same port
		- forward if on different ports
	- break up loops (spanning tree)
		- network protocol that builds a logical loop-free topology for ethernet networks. 

Difference between ARP table and CAM table
	- CAM tables to map MAC to port number (used by switches)
	- ARP maps MAC to IP

CAM table needs to have periodic updates or it times out

3 ways of forwarding traffic (switch)
	- FastForward (cut-through)
		- checks just enough to see where to send it
		- lowest latency
		- no error checking
	- FragmentFree (modified cut-through or hybrid)
		- checks that the header is good - would catch most collisions
		- low latency
		- filters most errors
	- Store-and-Forward (default)
		- Checks the entire frame
		- highest latency
		- all errors filtered

Blocking vs non-blocking
	- Non-blocking: internal bandwidth can handle all the port bandwidths, at the same time, at full capacity
		- sum of all ports maximum bandwidth is less than backplane bandwidth
		- backplane is internal architecture capacity
	- Almost all switches today are non-blocking

Lecture 13: More VLAN

11.18.16

802.# is the standard working group
802.#x is the standard feature

ARP Flush Timeout
	- Default is 14,400 seconds (4 hours)
	- Configurable from 60 to 86,400 seconds (24 hours)
CAM Table Timeout - 300 secs (5 mins)
Ethernet Keepalives (sends them every 10 seconds)

Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU)
	- Data message transmitted across a LAn to detect loops in network topologies 

VLAN - Virtual Broadcast Domain within a switched LAN
	- Effectively segments switches into separate LANs
	- Invisible to each other (security improved, fewer broadcasts)
	- Each has its own UP address pool (network)
	- Lets us use multiple IP addresses within a network

	- Establishes broadcast domains

Trunk Link - can carry multiple VLANs (multiple IP networks)
	- Special link that by default carries all VLANs

Routers are the only device that can forward traffic between VLANs
	- Do not forward broadcasts (keeps broadcasts from spreading)

VLANs partition the network to carry multiple IP networks

VLAn Frame Identification

Nothing in a switch would allow VLANs to see each other

VLAN Tagging was developed specifically for tagging
	- Allows the packets to move back and forth
	- Switch forwards based on the tag
	- Multi-VLAN, inter-switch communications
	- Places a unique identifier (tag) in header of each frame
	- functions at layer 2

IEEE 802.1Q Trunks (Tagging)
	- open standard using frame tags to label traffic
	- like an event badge, determines where you go

VLAN Identification Tags
	- 2 byte Tag Control Information (TCI)
		- identifier plus priority (video vs voice) and drop eligible codes

VLAn Examples
	- IP Desk Phones
	- Video Cameras
	- Credit Card readers
	- Door Access Card Readers
	- Point of Sale Devices
	- Video Displays

Switching Loop or Bridge

Loop can occur anytime there is a redundant path or  loop in the Layer 2 network
	- They are prevented by blocking the redundant path
	- Blocked link opens up if forwarding link fails

	- STP removes the redundant paths

More redundancy, more loops

Traditional Design
	- no loops
	- lots of single point failures

Redundancy design
	- Lots of loops
	- CAM table or MAC address flapping
		- switches are burning themselves up moving MAC addresses around in the table
	- Broadcasts trigger both

	- STP blocks one of the paths so looping will not occur
		- loops get cut off

Redundancy
	- avoid stranded networks
	- to ensure availability 
Spanning Tree
	- Blocks redundant link
With VLANs
	- Each link can forward one VLAN
		- block the other

Network topology change
	- added device
	- failed link or device

STP election
	- devices share BPDUs (bridge protocol data unit)
	- select blocked links
	- occurs automatically
	- can be programmed to control outcome

Lecture 14: Wireless Technologies
11.30.16

Cellular
	- 1G: really just VoIP
	- 2G: Texting (took a long time)
	- 3G: Music streaming, caller ID, location information
	- 4G: LTE: speeds are super fast (like a wired network)

A big leap in capability in each advance in each generation
	- More speed, more features

Anatomy of cell system
	- Cell connects to the cell tower, goes to base station (tells the signal where to go)
	- Determines which cell to go to

Cellular today
	- Networks are moving closer to users
	- Big cell sites are providing wide coverage
	- Other options provide capacity/bandwidth
		- Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS)
		- Small cells
		- Metro/small/micro cells

Metrocells
	- compact and discrete mobile phone basestations, unobstrusively located in urban areas
	- can be mounted on lampposts, positioned on the sides of buildings or found indoors in stadiums, transport hubs and other public areas
	- provide excellent mobile phone service, delivering very high data speeds and capacity, solving the problem of growing data traffic demand cost effectively

Metro, small, and micro cells are within buildings

LTE-LAA (Licensed Assisted Access) (licensed)

LTE-Unlicensed
	- enhanced ux with licensed anchor for control and mobility
	- better capacity and range compared to wi-fi
	- good neighbor to wi-fi, going beyond minimum requirements to ensure fair coexistence
	- unified LTE network with common management of licensed and unlicensed system

Ad hoc network: LAN that is built simultaneously as devices connect
	- Instead of relying on a base station to coordinate the flow of messages to each node in the network, the individual network nodes forward packets to and from each other

Wi-Fi (Wireless LAN)
	- Divided into 2 parts
	- Slower because it is half-duplex (can't transmit and receive simultaneously)
	- 1997 - 802.11 (2Mbps max), 2.4 GHz
	- 1999 - 802.11a (54 Mbps max), 5 GHz band
	- 1999 - 802.11b (11 Mbps max), 
	- 2007 - incorporated standards into 802.11
		- a, b, d, e, g, h, i, j 
			- defij add capabilities 
	- 2009 - 802.11n (54-600 Mbps), 2.4 & 5 GHz
		- Allows you to put both channels to double the speeds 
	- 2012 - incorporated standards
		- 802.11 k, r ,y , n, w, p, z, v, u, s to 802.11 - 2007 base
	- 2013 - 802.11ac 5 GHz only increased speeds, wider channels
		- Current version of what is out today
	- 2016 - 802.11ac 'wave 2', wider channels, multiple transmit
		- Send and talk to 2 different devices at once now
	- 2010 - 802.11ad (first product out now). 60 GHz band+
		- no one used it when it was released and a company just released something that supports this now (2016)
	- Future (late 2017-2018) - 802.11ax release
		- top speeds of 10 Gbps targeted
		- improved efficiencies
		- targeted for dense environments
	
Why you never really reach top speed
	- For example, 100 Mbps max
	- You can either talk 50% or listen 50%
	- It's not full-duplex, and things get lost as well
	- Some packet loss makes it resend

Wi-Fi terms
	- Wi-Fi service sets
		- SSID (Service Set Identifier): network name, identifies network
		- IBSS (Independent Basic Service Set): direct computer to computer wi-fi, adhoc wi-fi
		- BSS (Basic Service Set): Wi-Fi through an access point
		- ESS (Extended Service Set): multiple access points with a single SSID working to form a single network
			- UW's network is an ESS

Wi-Fi Channels
	- 2.4 GHz
		- 3 non-overlapping channels (1-6-11) (quiz/test/important/exam)
		- other channels overlap with each other (1-5 interfere with each other)
	- 5 GHz
		- More channels, more complicated 
		- 9 overlapping regular channels 
		- DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) + 15 more
			- These frequencies are used for other purposes
			- Primarily used for other things, like military or weather radars
			- Happens automatically within a system
	- Wider channels
		- 40 MHz added in 802.11n
		- 80 MHz added in 802.11ac
		- 160 MHz added in 802.11ac 'wave 2'
		- More speed

Co-channel interference (important/exam)
	- 2 devices talking on the same channel interfering with each other
	- 2 APs on the same channel cuts the bandwidth in half

Adjacent-channel interference (important/exam)
	- 2 overlapping channels are being used 
		- channels 1 and 2 used at the same time (decrease bandwith)

Non-Wi-Fi interference (important/exam)
	- Bluetooth using the same frequency (2.4 GHz) that wi-fi does
	- same for a microwave
	- These other devices don't do CSMA/CD. They will not listen before they send 

Large room with many devices connected has a lot more interference
